Intrinsic Image Decomposition,"Intrinsic Image Decomposition is the process of separating an image into its formation components such as reflectance (albedo) and shading (illumination). Reflectance is the color of the object, invariant to camera viewpoint and illumination conditions, whereas shading, dependent on camera viewpoint and object geometry, consists of different illumination effects, such as shadows, shading and inter-reflections. Using intrinsic images, instead of the original images, can be beneficial for many computer vision algorithms. For instance, for shape-from-shading algorithms, the shading images contain important visual cues to recover geometry, while for segmentation and detection algorithms, reflectance images can be beneficial as they are independent of confounding illumination effects. Furthermore, intrinsic images are used in a wide range of computational photography applications, such as material recoloring, relighting, retexturing and stylization.

Imitation Learning,"Imitation Learning is a framework for learning a behavior policy from demonstrations. Usually, demonstrations are presented in the form of state-action trajectories, with each pair indicating the action to take at the state being visited. In order to learn the behavior policy, the demonstrated actions are usually utilized in two ways. The first, known as Behavior Cloning (BC), treats the action as the target label for each state, and then learns a generalized mapping from states to actions in a supervised manner. Another way, known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), views the demonstrated actions as a sequence of decisions, and aims at finding a reward/cost function under which the demonstrated decisions are optimal.
Finally, a newer methodology, Inverse Q-Learning aims at directly learning Q-functions from expert data, implicitly representing rewards, under which the optimal policy can be given as a Boltzmann distribution similar to soft Q-learning

Knowledge Distillation,"A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel. Source: Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network

Video Classification,"Video Classification is the task of producing a label that is relevant to the video given its frames. A good video level classifier is one that not only provides accurate frame labels, but also best describes the entire video given the features and the annotations of the various frames in the video. For example, a video might contain a tree in some frame, but the label that is central to the video might be something else (e.g., “hiking”). The granularity of the labels that are needed to describe the frames and the video depends on the task. Typical tasks include assigning one or more global labels to the video, and assigning one or more labels for each frame inside the video.

Abnormal Event Detection In Video,"Abnormal Event Detection In Video is a challenging task in computer vision, as the definition of what an abnormal event looks like depends very much on the context. For instance, a car driving by on the street is regarded as a normal event, but if the car enters a pedestrian area, this is regarded as an abnormal event. A person running on a sports court (normal event) versus running outside from a bank (abnormal event) is another example. Although what is considered abnormal depends on the context, we can generally agree that abnormal events should be unexpected events that occur less often than familiar (normal) events

Medical Image Registration is used in many clinical applications such as image guidance, motion tracking, segmentation, dose accumulation, image reconstruction and so on. Medical Image Registration is a broad topic which can be grouped from various perspectives. From input image point of view, registration methods can be divided into unimodal, multimodal, interpatient, intra-patient (e.g. same- or different-day) registration. From deformation model point of view, registration methods can be divided in to rigid, affine and deformable methods. From region of interest (ROI) perspective, registration methods can be grouped according to anatomical sites such as brain, lung registration and so on. From image pair dimension perspective, registration methods can be divided into 3D to 3D, 3D to 2D and 2D to 2D/3D.

Video Salient Object Detection,"Video salient object detection (VSOD) is significantly essential for understanding the underlying mechanism behind HVS during free-viewing in general and instrumental to a wide range of real-world applications, e.g., video segmentation, video captioning, video compression, autonomous driving, robotic interaction, weakly supervised attention. Besides its academic value and practical significance, VSOD presents great difficulties due to the challenges carried by video data (diverse motion patterns, occlusions, blur, large object deformations, etc.) and the inherent complexity of human visual attention behavior (i.e., selective attention allocation, attention shift) during dynamic scenes. Online benchmark: http://dpfan.net/davsod.

Video Summarization,"Video Summarization aims to generate a short synopsis that summarizes the video content by selecting its most informative and important parts. The produced summary is usually composed of a set of representative video frames (a.k.a. video key-frames), or video fragments (a.k.a. video key-fragments) that have been stitched in chronological order to form a shorter video. The former type of a video summary is known as video storyboard, and the latter type is known as video skim.

Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"The semantic segmentation task is to assign a label from a label set to each pixel in an image. In the case of fully supervised setting, the dataset consists of images and their corresponding pixel-level class-specific annotations (expensive pixel-level annotations). However, in the weakly-supervised setting, the dataset consists of images and corresponding annotations that are relatively easy to obtain, such as tags/labels of objects present in the image.

Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Retrieval,"Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Retrieval is the task of finding relevant items across different modalities without having received any training examples. For example, given an image, find a text or vice versa. The main challenge in the task is known as the heterogeneity gap: since items from different modalities have different data types, the similarity between them cannot be measured directly. Therefore, the majority of methods published to date attempt to bridge this gap by learning a latent representation space, where the similarity between items from different modalities can be measured.

Camouflaged Object Segmentation,"Camouflaged object segmentation (COS) or Camouflaged object detection (COD), which was originally promoted by T.-N. Le et al. (2017), aims to identify objects that conceal their texture into the surrounding environment. The high intrinsic similarities between the target object and the background make COS/COD far more challenging than the traditional object segmentation task. Also, refer to the online benchmarks on CAMO dataset, COD dataset, and online demo.
